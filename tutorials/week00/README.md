Week0 Information
=========================

Please refer to canvas for video's to assist in conjunction with the exercises provided.

First and foremost, the subject is delivered on Linux OS (Ubuntu) so we initially discuss circumnavigating Linux. Then we move to CMake, which is the build system used, this let's you compile code and create libraries and executable(s). We then also introduce Visual Studio Code as Integrated Development Environment, that you write code in.

It is *ESSENTIAL* you have Linux installed and have compiled our sample code to be able to partake in Week 01 activities.

The below introduces

* Linux filesystem

* Bash operations

* cmake 

* compiling (out of source build)

* git (version control)

* Visual Studio Code - aka vscode (the IDE we will be using)

Consult the videos on canvas to achieve below.

Ex01 - Files on Linux
--------------------
* Create a directory (mkdir)
* Create a text file in it (use gedit and nano)
* Make a copy of the file and modify it (cp)
* Delete the original


Ex02 - Using GIT
--------------------
* create a week00 folder in scratch
* create a text note in that folder
* add/commit/push to git repo


Ex03 and Ex04 - use sample provided 
--------------------------
* copy  tutorials/week00 to scratch/week00/


Ex03 - Compiling cmake projects (command line only)
---------------------
Compile [hello.cpp](./starter/hello.cpp)

* change directory to starter
* create build directory 
* run cmake
* run make
* run executable 
* modify cout text to use your name "Hello <YOUR_NAME>"
* rebuild and run
* commit modified project (without build products)

Ex04 - Compiling cmake projects (vscode)
---------------------
Compile [hello.cpp](./starter/hello.cpp)
* create build directory
* start vscode ``code``
* rebuild and run
