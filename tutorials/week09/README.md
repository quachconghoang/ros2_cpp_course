Week 9 
=========================

You have already installed ROS2 and set-up your ros2 workspace `ros2_ws` at the begining of teh semester (you have this already done on Azure). This is needed both for quiz4 as well as tutorial this week.

**[PRE-WORK is Quiz4](../../quizzes/quiz4/README.md)** and [CANVAS Week 09 Prework](https://canvas.uts.edu.au/courses/30581/pages/week-09-prework)

You need to complete the CANVAS pre-work to effectively partake in the **[TUTORIAL](./TUTORIAL.md)**

The canvas pre work:

1. shows [using turtlesim, ros2, and rqt](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html)

2. Examine [looking at nodes](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes.html)

3. [Understanding topics](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html)

4. [Understanding services](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Services/Understanding-ROS2-Services.html)

5. ROS [logging mechanism](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Using-Rqt-Console/Using-Rqt-Console.html)

We use all these in the TUTORIAL.

ROS2 is a software framework for software development, it has middleware designed for heterogeneous computer clusters, such as [hardware abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_abstraction), low-level [device control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver), implementation of commonly used functionality (libraries), [message-passing between processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication), and package management.
