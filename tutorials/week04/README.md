Week 4 
=========================

For prework review Assignment 1 material, the [a1_skeleton](../../skeleton/2024a_a1_skeleton) and the [a1_snippets](../../scratch/a1_snippets). We will also assist students working on Assignment 1, so a 20min block at beginning and at end of class will be dedicated to a Q&A session.

Material for [TUTORIAL](./TUTORIAL.md) assist in understanding the Assessment as we cover libraries. You will be using the two libraries 

- **pfmsconnector** - to interact with the simulator 
- **audi** - to compute steering angles for the ackerman

Finally, distributing your own library is beyond the scope of this subject, though some material is part of  [ADVANCED](./ADVANCED.md).
