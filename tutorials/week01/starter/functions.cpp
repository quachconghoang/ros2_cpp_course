// Functions are the building blocks of any programming language. They allow us to encapsulate a block of code
// and execute it whenever we want. This is useful for code reuse and readability.
//
// Functions are defined with the following syntax:
// <return type> <function name> (<parameters>) {
//     <function body>
// }


// Ex01. 
//* Create a function named 'square` that accepts a double value as a parameter and
//* Returns a bool value if the double is greater than zero 
//* The parameter passed needs to be squared, so it get's returned as a square value to the caller
//*
//* Create an function named `randomize` that accepts a structure `Sensor` and populates data with random values (mean 5.0 standard deviation 3.0)

// Every executable needs a main function which returns an int
int main () {

	//Call the functions, obtain values and print to screen (using std::cout) 


    return 0;
}
