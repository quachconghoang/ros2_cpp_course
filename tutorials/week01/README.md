# Week 1 Pre-work

Attempting pre-work enables students to partake in class. To understand a concept you will need to reflect on it, you will need to have been introduced to a concept in order to be capable of reflecting on a  concept. Therefore, seeing a concept for the very first time in class will not be effective.

Pre-work for week 1 is refresher of concepts you have covered thus far in Embedded Mechatronic Systems (Mechatronics 1): pointers, arrays, enums.

Week 1 Tutorial Questions
=========================

In the tutorial we will cover other essentials concepts that you should have covered thus far in Embedded Mechatronic Systems (Mechatronics 1) and Programming 1: functions, structs. All of these are basics of C and will be used in C++.

We introduce one new concept from C++ that we will use extensively going forward, a vector. Vectors belong to the Standard Template Library (STD) that is part of C++ suite of libraries. With this, our journey into C++ features begins in week 1!
